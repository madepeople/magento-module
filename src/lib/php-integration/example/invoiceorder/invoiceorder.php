// get config object
$myConfig = Svea\SveaConfig::getTestConfig(); //replace with class holding your merchantid, secretword, et al, adopted from package Config/SveaConfig.php

// We assume that you've collected the following information about the order in your shop:

// customer information:
$customerFirstName = "Tess T";
$customerLastName = "Persson";
$customerAddress = "Testgatan 1";
$customerZipCode = "99999";
$customerCity = "Stan";
$customerCountry = "Sverige";

// The customer has bought three items, one "Billy" which cost 700,99 kr excluding vat (25%) and two hotdogs for 5 kr (incl. vat).

// We'll also need information about the customer country, and the currency used for this order, etc., see below

// Start the order creation process by creating the order builder object by calling WebPay::createOrder():
$myOrder = WebPay::createOrder( $myConfig );

// You then add information to the order object by using the methods in the Svea\CreateOrderBuilder class.
// For an Invoice order, the following methods are required:
$myOrder->setCountryCode("SE");                         // customer country, we recommend basing this on the customer billing address
//$myOrder->setCurrency("SEK");                           // order currency
// You may also chain fluent methods together:
$myOrder
//        ->setClientOrderNumber("order #20140519-375")   // optional - use a not previously sent client side order identifier, i.e. "order #20140519-371"
//        ->setCustomerReference("customer #123")         // optional - This should contain a customer reference, as in "customer #123".
        ->setOrderDate("2014-05-28")                    // required - or use an ISO801 date as produced by i.e. date('c')
;
// Then specify the items bought as order rows, using the methods in the Svea\OrderRow class, and adding them to the order:
$firstBoughtItem = WebPayItem::orderRow();
$firstBoughtItem->setAmountExVat( 10.99 );
$firstBoughtItem->setVatPercent( 25 );
$firstBoughtItem->setQuantity( 1 );
$firstBoughtItem->setDescription( "Billy" );
$firstBoughtItem->setArticleNumber("123456789A");

// Add firstBoughtItem to order row
$myOrder->addOrderRow( $firstBoughtItem ); 

// Add secondBoughtItem in a fluent fashion 
$myOrder->addOrderRow( 
            WebPayItem::orderRow()
                ->setAmountIncVat( 5.00 )
                ->setVatPercent( 12 )
                ->setQuantity( 2 )
                ->setDescription( "Korv med brÃ¶d" )
);

// For card orders the ->addCustomerDetails() method is optional, but recommended, so we'll add what info we have
$myCustomerInformation = WebPayItem::individualCustomer(); // there's also a ::companyCustomer() method, used for non-person entities

$myCustomerInformation->setName( $customerFirstName, $customerLastName);
$sveaAddress = Svea\Helper::splitStreetAddress($customerAddress); // Svea requires an address and a house number
$myCustomerInformation->setStreetAddress( $sveaAddress[0], $sveaAddress[1] );
$myCustomerInformation->setZipCode( $customerZipCode )->setLocality( $customerCity );
$myCustomerInformation->setNationalIdNumber(194605092222); // required for invoice orders, used to determine the invoice address, see WebPay::getAddress()

$myOrder->addCustomerDetails( $myCustomerInformation );

// We have now completed specifying the order, and wish to send the payment request to Svea. To do so, we first select a payment method.
// We'll use the invoice order method.
$myInvoiceOrderRequest = $myOrder->useInvoicePayment();

// Then send the request to Svea, and immediately receive the service response object
$myResponse = $myInvoiceOrderRequest->doRequest();

// Check the response attribute 'accepted' for true to see if the request succeeded, if not, see the attributes resultcode and/or errormessage
echo "<pre>Your request response:\n\n";
print_r( $myResponse );

echo "</pre><font color='red'><pre>\n";
echo "Note that the customerIdentity received in the response indicates the Svea invoice address, which should normally match the order shipping address.";
